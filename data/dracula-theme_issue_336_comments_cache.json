Any kind of update requests should be dealt in the theme's repo (like you already did).\r\n\r\nI understand it might be frustrating to have a theme that's not fully compatible with the latest version of the software. I'm also pretty sure opening a new issue here won't help much either since (probably) none of the theme users will be watching this repo.\r\n\r\nAnyone willing to help updating this, please head to https://github.com/dracula/blender/issues/1 👍 ",
