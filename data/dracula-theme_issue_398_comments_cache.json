        "body": "Thanks for providing this feedback, you guys are awesome!\r\n\r\nLet me share some opinions about GitHub Discussions and Discourse:\r\n\r\n1. First of all, it looks amazing. It's a shiny new thing, and whenever there's a new thing, there's always excitement and hope. Unfortunately, we don't know if that feature is really going to be adopted, remember [Team Discussions](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-team-discussions)?\r\n1. Even after [GitHub Satellite's announcement yesterday](https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/), there's still no clear timeline of when this is going to be available.\r\n1. The [Answered](https://github.com/githubevents/satellite2020/discussions/4) functionality is at the core of the entire experience, which shows their intention to be more like a StackOverflow than a forum tool. One of my ideas is to foster the culture of [sharing your setup](https://community.draculatheme.com/t/my-sublime-text-setup/18), like the [unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) and [vimporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/vimporn) communities on Reddit. In those cases, there's no right or wrong answer, just people sharing content.\r\n1. Only last year, the draculatheme.com site had more than 1 million page views. This means that the domain has a strong authority and it's easy to be found by search engines. Having a tool running under that domain will not only help SEO, but also with discoverability. When people search for something, it will be easier for them to find it.\r\n1. One interesting aspect that we didn't leverage yet is Private Discussions. If there's a delicate topic that we need to discuss, private topics can help with that.\r\n1. One of the things I like about Discourse is the gamification aspect. Since it was built by the creator of StackOverflow, they do a really good job encouraging positive community behaviors with [badges and trust system](https://www.discourse.org/features).\r\n1. Dracula is a theme and being able to customize any interface with that theme is really nice, it creates a unique identity. Discourse allows us to apply any CSS we want, while GitHub Discussion will not provide the ability to customize their interface.\r\n\r\nWith all that being said, there's still a lot of advantages of using GitHub Discussions. It doesn't require you to create another account in another place. It's free and it's one less software to maintain.\r\n\r\nI guess we can wait a couple of weeks to see how this all plays out.\r\n\r\nAny other opinions you want to share?",

        "body": "How perfect @BlakeWilliams :)\r\n\r\n1) I'm 99% sure it will be adopted. People already use Issues for discussion. Team Discussions isn't used because it's generally just a bad idea. Why use that instead of Slack?\r\n\r\n2) Seems like we have an in for early access\r\n\r\n3) Just because it has an Answered button doesn't mean it has to be used like SO.\r\n\r\n4) I feel searching for discussions on GH will be a lot easier than having to know Dracula has a third party forum tool. Keeping everything in one place (issues, PRs, discussions of other sorts, etc.) means that you don't have to browse to another tool to discuss a different topic. And you can open an issue from a discussion I believe, which is pretty powerful.\r\n\r\n5) Not sure if the feature will have that, but it makes sense. However, I think private topics can easily be handled in Slack, as it isn't something the public community would need access to anyways. Other avenues would be twitter group DMs, etc. if GitHub isn't adding private discussions (which it should).\r\n\r\n6) I rarely browse SO, but I will tell you, I've never once paid any attention to their badges. I browse it via Google, get my answer, and get out. SO is a pain to use personally, so following them as an example is not necessarily a great idea.\r\n\r\n7) Being able to theme it would certainly be nice.

If we do go ahead with it there are a couple things that I have questions/suggestions on.\r\n\r\n1. When GitHub discussions goes up will we transition to using that if we have a forum set up? If so, what could we do to smooth over the transition between them.\r\n2. Will issues still be used on GitHub, or will this be a hybrid forum/bug tracker sort of deal?\r\n3. To smooth the transition, we should try and figure out a way for users to login to the forum with their existing GitHub accounts.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I am heavily in favour of developing a community forum for the theme, as it would allow direct interaction with the user base to be much more streamlined than it currently is with the issue system.",
