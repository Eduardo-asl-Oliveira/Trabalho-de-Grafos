I will make further changes to the README once we nail down the permanent repository name.\r\n\r\nOn that note, I think that dracula/ghpages would be more fitting, because while the theme would most likely _work fine_ with any jekyll site, it would require quite a few changes by the user to remove and add elements they need. I also do not plan to provide support for full jekyll use, only GitHub Pages.\r\n\r\n### GitHub Pages Preview & Travis CI\r\n\r\nOn another note, I tried to enable the repos GitHub Pages preview, however since the org is remapped to draculatheme.com we will need to setup this one a little special.\r\n\r\nAs you said the theme info will be at draculatheme.com/gh-pages, so I think it would be appropriate to have the preview at draculatheme.com/gh-pages/preview.\r\n\r\nTravis CI will also need to be enabled and I plan to do that once the repository is at it's new name.",
