I didn't know that Patchwork had a Dracula theme built in.\r\n\r\nSince I'm not a Patchwork user I wouldn't be able to describe the installation instructions and how to activate the theme. However, you could do that and I can still add to the website, here's how...\r\n\r\nYou can create a new repo following this template: https://github.com/dracula/template\r\nJust make sure you take a good screenshot, and add all the instructions in the `INSTALL.md` file. All pages on the draculatheme.com website use that file to be auto-generated.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.",
