        "body": "Not sure if this is the appropriate place, but it's about Dracula and tmux, so I guess it fits.\r\n\r\nAfter checking this recent release I realized that my tmux needed a revamp to match my whole Dracula setup. However, I'm already using the great [Oh My Tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) configuration file. Inspired by this release and Dracula's Vim Airline theme, I decided setting up a minimal \"theme\" for Oh My Tmux.\r\n\r\nSo that's what I did!: \r\nhttps://github.com/atgmello/dracula.omt\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4420461/79346909-4fe40c00-7f09-11ea-8d86-2cf8e1d845d7.png)\r\n\r\nI'd note that @mamyn0va 's effort is appreciated. However I'd like to keep my version up to date with @gpakosz 's repo and also keep my other configuration intact. I guess that what I came up with solves both issues.\r\n\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank the whole Dracula Team! You're doing an amazing job porting such an awesome theme for so many apps! :)",
