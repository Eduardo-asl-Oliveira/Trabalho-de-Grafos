Not exactly sure what you're looking for here, so some more information would be appreciated if it means could help you get what you were originally interested in.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the [GTK Dracula theme](https://github.com/dracula/gtk) and are talking about support for new icons in that theme, probably would be best to move as a a new issue under that specific repo to get support from the folks maintaining those.
