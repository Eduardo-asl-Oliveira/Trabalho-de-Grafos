We understand the importance of keeping you informed about the progress of your submissions and apologize for the delay. 🙇🏻\r\n\r\n> However, please avoid using offensive words or aggressively expressing displeasure. We are a small team and often need to prioritize one task at a time.\r\n\r\n✅ With this in mind, I have transferred the submitted theme first and invited both to collaborate directly in the repository.",
