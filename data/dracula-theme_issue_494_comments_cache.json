        "body": "> All good @Dhyfer1! https://draculatheme.com/ditto ;)\r\n\r\nHi again @zenorocha \r\n\r\nI am writing to you for 4 reasons:\r\n\r\n1.  First of all I want to thank you because my theme is listed on draculatheme.com as well as in the dracula-theme repository on Github. Again, thank you very much. 😊😀\r\n2.  Before my theme was approved and uploaded, I could edit the INSTALL.md file but now I can't edit it and when the cursor hovers over the edit icon I get this message: \"You must be on a branch to make or propose changes to this file\". The reason why the INSTALL.md file needs to be edited is that the part where Ctrl+/ appears is wrong, since Ditto is activated by default using the hotkey ``(Ctrl+`)`` or the Ctrl key together with the punctuation mark ``(`)``.\r\nSo, please, edit the INSTALL.md file and replace this: \r\n```\r\n`Ctrl + /`\r\n``` \r\nwith this: \r\n```\r\n<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd>\r\n```\r\nAfter editing that part in the md file, it will look like this: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd>\r\n\r\n3. When you finish editing the md file, it is also necessary to correct the hotkey in draculatheme.com/ditto and also correct the content inside the squares that you see in the next image. Above you can see the part of \"Activate theme\" in the INSTALL.md file and below its equivalent in <url>https://draculatheme.com/ditto</url>\r\n![msedge_bEs7UtLOmR](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50301201/105647959-eec56d80-5e76-11eb-99d7-cd17b7d6cba3.png)\r\n\r\n4. When I create another theme I know I have to use this [color palette](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme#color-palette) but... can I use also some colors from your site draculatheme.com?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThat's all, and thank you for your attention. :)\r\n",

        "body": "> I just regenerated the site: https://draculatheme.com/ditto\r\n> \r\n> For some weird reason, I can still see that `b`. I have absolutely no idea why this is happening :(\r\n\r\nHi @zenorocha \r\nI looked at the site again and you're right, it looks like that b doesn't want to leave. 😅 and the hotkey part is correct. \r\n\r\nOk, then you have to modify the site again, sorry, but it will be very easy for you with the changes I am going to tell you, I believe that with these changes you will be able to see it correctly on the site:\r\n\r\n- In point 1 of the site it only changes from this: `b\u0013 i.e. hold down Ctrl and press the back-quote (tilde ~) key` to this: `i.e. hold down Ctrl and press the back-quote (tilde ~) key`\r\n- In the same point 1, change this: `menu icon b\u000b/` to this: `three dots`\r\n\r\nEasy, right? So that in the end it can look like this: \r\n**Open Ditto by clicking its icon in the system tray or by pressing its Hot Key which defaults to Ctrl+` i.e. hold down Ctrl and press the back-quote (tilde ~) key, and go to its settings (click on the three dots of the lower right corner and click on Options.)**\r\n\r\nNow, about the Ditto INSTALL.md file, have you seen the differences between [this one](https://github.com/dracula/ditto/blob/master/INSTALL.md) and [this one](https://github.com/dracula/ditto/blob/e76aefb151d289fcf01262597c092e6d9195b288/INSTALL.md)? The md file in the first link I edited it without problem but I can't edit the md file in the second link to be the same as the first link because I don't have permissions to edit it, so if it's no problem I would like you to edit it to match the one that I edited, just look at the instructions in point 2 that I left you two messages up. ⬆\r\n\r\nThat´s all. I look forward to your answer :)\r\n",
