Tbh I think the sample folder should be removed completely, the screenshots are good enough.\r\n\r\nI've opened a PR with these changes, hopefully you agree.\r\n\r\nAnother thing: the license notice in `beamercolorthemedracula.sty` conflicts with the `LICENSE` file. I'm not quite sure how to resolve this, @zenorocha what do you think?",

Here are some important things to keep in mind:\r\n\r\n* All repositories use the name `master` as the default branch. I see that you added `main` which is quite nice, however this will break the pattern with all the other repositories and will affect how the site works. That's why I had to move back to master.\r\n* All repositories need a `screenshot.png` for the site to pick them up.\r\n* All repositories should be lowercase in order for the site to work properly.",
