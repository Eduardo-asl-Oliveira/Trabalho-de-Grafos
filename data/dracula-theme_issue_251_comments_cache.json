I also sent you an invite to join the Dracula org. You'll continue maintaining this project, the only difference is that we can make it more visible and include it on the [site](https://draculatheme.com).\r\n\r\nWe have the screenshot and instructions already, that's great! The next steps would be normalizing the README so it looks like the [template we did](https://github.com/dracula/template).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",
