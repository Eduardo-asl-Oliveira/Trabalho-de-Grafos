Once that is done, all of the code needs to be copied over. If we want to keep history, I think https://github.com/dflydev/git-subsplit might help unless someone knows another way.\n\nThe site also needs to be moved to it's own repository as organizations use a repository rather than a project for the hosted sites.\n\nOnce the move is done, we should create a release for each repository with whatever the current release number is. We also need to create a README.md for every repository. This might be a good way to build the site as well. The site builder could just use the README.md for each repository instead of having to duplicate the information.\n\nOnce a release is created for each repository, we need to update package managers such as Atom and anything else to point to the new repositories.\n\nI would probably also create a centralized repository that contains a README.md and an issue tracker. This is where people could submit issues to make changes to the color scheme (if needed), talk about supporting new editors and such, etc. This is also where the color scheme and general information would be stored.\n\nBut really we need @zenorocha to agree to this all first since he owns it all.\n",
