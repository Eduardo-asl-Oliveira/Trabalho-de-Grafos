I'm very tempted to grab Dracula Pro since  I can see there are definitely some changes in there which I prefer over the free available version(s), but I'm hesitant without knowing what the update policy is? \r\n\r\nHow are any updates distributed, and shared with customers who purchased the Pro version? If JetBrains or VS Code release a new version that breaks the Dracula Pro theme will there be an update released swiftly? If the bug @rarodja mentioned above has in fact existed since 2020 it makes me a little nervous.\r\n\r\nThe site for Dracula Pro (https://draculatheme.com/pro) makes ZERO mention of how updates are handled, and distributed? With the free versions we at least have oversight with the open source repositories, and can even potentially contribute fixes ourselves.",
