        "body": "Live at https://draculatheme.com/colorls 🎉  \r\n\r\nOne question I do have: what is the process (if any) for getting a specific theme's submodule version bumped on [dracula-theme](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) / [draculatheme.com](https://draculatheme.com/)? For example, since it's been added, I realized the main screenshot.png needed updated to the finalized color scheme, which I've since completed and pushed to master (and is reflected on the site's README), but now am curious how that get's updated to be reflected on https://draculatheme.com/colorls since it's tied to the older commit? \r\n\r\nBy the way, thanks! Looking forward to hopefully being able to contribute some more elsewhere",
