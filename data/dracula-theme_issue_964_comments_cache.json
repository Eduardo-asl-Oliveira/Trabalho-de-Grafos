So I have to do it in traditional way by reading from left instead of catching the function name directly by its color highlighting.\r\n\r\nNow let's go to line 3, is it actually that much difference between the black and the green? I mean if you step away from the monitor, they all look like black. Same goes to the yellow.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to say is that the current color highlighting for Alucard looks like all black to me such as words on a white paper. The color contrast is not that obvious compare to Dracula which is fantastic.",
