I would encourage you to consider contributing back to dracula/vim instead of trying to maintain two parallel themes… it would be great to see the best of both worlds in one place, I think.\n> \n> Hi, I get that you wanted to have everything in a single repository, but I believe it would be better to have separate themes for each text editor. That way, you don't have to worry about Neovim and its plugins. I think it would be easier for Dracula/Vim if they focused solely on improving the Vim syntax instead of trying to support Neovim\n\nI completely agree with this take. The current `dracula/vim` theme, lacks a lot of support especially when you lazy load plugins (cmp for example), also the last issues in the dracula/vim are mostly about neovim. \n\nWhy not have different repository?  They are different editors.\nThis way I also think it will help a lot the neovim community because this is written in lua hence it would be a lot easier to contribute and read the code.\n",

        "body": "> The current `dracula/vim` theme, lacks a lot of support especially when you lazy load plugins (cmp for example)\r\n\r\nI've been meaning to try to address this, but it's not trivial to detect when a plugin is loaded in the middle of the editor running. I think the solution is for dracula/vim to unconditionally link plugin related groups? cf. https://github.com/dracula/vim/pull/301 (And why lazy load anyway? If most code is behind `autoload`, it shouldn't be a big deal, but maybe I misunderstand the purpose of lazy load?)\r\n\r\n> also the last issues in the dracula/vim are mostly about neovim.\r\n\r\nTo me this indicates interest in improving dracula/vim to include NeoVim compatibility, not necessarily interest in splitting off entirely.\r\n\r\n> Why not have different repository? They are different editors. This way I also think it will help a lot the neovim community because this is written in lua hence it would be a lot easier to contribute and read the code.\r\n\r\nHow different the editors are is debatable, given the compatibility focus for many major features.\r\n\r\n[The actual highlighting code](https://github.com/maxmx03/dracula.nvim/blob/master/lua/dracula/themes/init.lua) is almost the same in Lua as in Vimscript, and the layout of all the Lua files is harder to follow if you aren't used to the Lua+Vim structure… Stringly-typed APIs like the one in this link are also not the easiest to use, IMO.\r\n\r\nWhat is being done in Lua that couldn't be done clearly in the original?\r\n\r\nFrom poking around, the major differences I see are\r\n- the \"soft\" variant (what is this?)\r\n- the initialization code is more complicated because of Lua\r\n- the require/Lua organization practically re-invents all of the existing `:colorscheme name` mechanism (which just executes the corresponding file), switching it for a `setup` method\r\n\r\nI don't want to be hostile to change. I just believe fragmenting things is the wrong way to go, and getting a dedicated group together to improve the state of dracula/vim would be better than two independent groups trying to keep up with each other in ad-hoc ways. I'm sure @dsifford and I are willing to take on more maintainers with a NeoVim focus (my focus is typically very Vim, since that's what I use, but I try to review NeoVim-related things where I can).\r\n",

        "body": "> > The current `dracula/vim` theme, lacks a lot of support especially when you lazy load plugins (cmp for example)\n> \n> I've been meaning to try to address this, but it's not trivial to detect when a plugin is loaded in the middle of the editor running. I think the solution is for dracula/vim to unconditionally link plugin related groups? cf. [dracula/vim#301](https://github.com/dracula/vim/pull/301) (And why lazy load anyway? If most code is behind `autoload`, it shouldn't be a big deal, but maybe I misunderstand the purpose of lazy load?)\n\nFWIW, we addressed this in dracula/vim@8dc19c1 (chore!: remove the after directory, 2024-03-16).\n\n@maxmx03 and others: if there are still things that NeoVim-specific variants are doing that we can do in the mainline theme, please let us know. I think the recent track of merging NeoVim-related code and fixes demonstrates our willingness to keep dracula/vim a solid choice across both editors.\n\nTagging the following folks based on their contributions to NeoVim variants of Dracula:\n- @pze\n- @Mofiqul\n- @lucasheartcliff\n- @binhtran432k",
