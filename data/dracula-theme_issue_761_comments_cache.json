OP just suggest changing the supported application to PrismLauncher, instead of PolyMC or MultiMC.\r\nAs explained accurately in the FAQ provided by OP,\r\nMultiMC : Original Launcher. Was forked into PolyMC due to restrictive software license, preventing repackaging and distribution for other Linux platforms which would require other package format.\r\nPolyMC : Was just recently forked into PrismLauncher due to political beliefs of repo owner, removing the code of conduct and removed previous maintainers from the project without prior consultation.",
