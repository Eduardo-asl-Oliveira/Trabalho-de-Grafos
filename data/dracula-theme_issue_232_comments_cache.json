Any ideas?~\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have several test cases to look at when looking at the highlightjs css.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Just kidding. It appears that highlightjs just doesn't play nicely with typescript. Switched to javascript and it seemed to work.\r\n\r\n**Edit 2:** After playing around with c++ and other typed languages in highlightjs, I'm not super keen on the idea of using highlightjs as an exemplary model of the spec. Because the scopes are so narrow, the result of adding in as much of the spec as I can will still result in a grossly incorrect picture of what it should be using TextMate scopes or some other format. Example being that types and keywords have the same scope, so `int main() { return 0;}` as an example, both `int` and `return` would be cyan, which is wrong. In that case, I think it should be pink, but that's wrong from the perspective of being an example.\r\n\r\nCan we instead just use screenshots?",

        "body": "@zenorocha Just checked out codemirror. The theme they have is probably as close as it's going to get already, but still way off because it doesn't allow customizations as fine-grained as textmate. \r\n\r\nCodemirror has no way of telling the difference between functions, classes, variables, etc so they all get scoped to `cm-variable`. From a textmate perspective, this is incorrect, but I understand the limitations. \r\n\r\nStill not super keen on the idea of using that as an example, but I'll defer that decision to you. I think the spec should define colors as fine grained as possible and then offer a \"fallback chain\" of colors to use in these sorts of circumstances. \r\n\r\nSo for example:\r\n\r\n**User-defined entities**\r\n\r\n```\r\nClasses: Cyan -> Green\r\nFunctions: Green\r\nVariables: Foreground -> Green\r\n```\r\n\r\n... etc, etc, etc",

        "body": "First of all, *thanks* for creating this RFC, I think this is very much needed.\r\n\r\nI will talk about the terminal (ANSI) colors as I have been working for a while on my own set of colors for tmux and powerline and I have been having issues on making them work properly on the two terminals that I use (konsole [KDE] and iterm2 [OSX] ).\r\n\r\nThe problem that we face is that the \"essential\" colors for ANSI are just 15 ( 0 to 15 on ANSI) and we need to treat carefuly the second 8: most (if not all) terminal applications relay on the basic 16 ANSI colors to stablish the colorschemes that they use.\r\n\r\nThat being said, in the standard Dracula palette there are 12 colors ( really 11 as \"Current Line\" and \"Selection\" are the same), so we need to do some sacrifices somewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the current version of the RFC, I see:\r\n\r\n- 1,2,3,5 and 6 ANSI colors match the colors from the Dracula palette.\r\n- 4 (AnsiBlue) is being replaced by the Purple from the Dracula palette.\r\n- 15 (AnsiBrightWhite) is being replaced by the Foreground from the Dracula palette.\r\n- Rest of the colors are custom versions trying to be \"bright\" versions of the 0-7 colors.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose:\r\n\r\n- 0 be 282a36 ( Background on the Dracula palette)\r\n- 8 be 44475a ( Current Line/Selection on the Dracula palette)\r\n\r\nWith this approach we will keep colors very similar to the original ANSI and we will only be missing two colors from the Dracula palette. Furthermore, I will propose also to add two colors to the RFC:\r\n\r\n- 61 to be 6272a4\r\n- 215 to be ffb86c\r\n\r\nSo terminal applications that support more than the basic 16 colors can use the Orange and Comment from the Dracula palette.\r\n\r\nI attach screenshots of the konsole colorscheme ( NOTE: colors here start on 1, not 0 as ANSI) and tmux and powerline apps running on konsole ( with the color definition also included) ( notice that the themes are *not* finished but are in good enough shape to use them as example):\r\n\r\n![dracula_ansi_konsole](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3227746/27556824-8ad08844-5ab7-11e7-9f76-11b5068a7125.png)\r\n![tmux_powerline_dracula_ansi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3227746/27556826-906be690-5ab7-11e7-9f49-b8a8979bc321.png)\r\n",

Thanks for commenting on that!\r\n\r\nI also took a stab at a color scheme for the ANSI colors, which provides a bit more contrast between base and highlight colors. To come up with the dark/light variations of the Dracula theme colors, I added or subtracted rgb(32, 32, 32) from each color. This way the hue always remains the same between the base and the highlight color, and the difference in lightness between base and highlight colors is consistent across each color.\r\n\r\nYou can take a look at the color scheme here: https://codepen.io/teddybradford/full/XZeRvg/\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!",
