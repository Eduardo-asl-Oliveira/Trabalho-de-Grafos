        "body": "Hi,\n\nI seem to have overlooked that a Dracula theme for Keypirinha already exists. Most likely because I mistyped the name when I first searched, which led me to believe there wasn’t one.\n\nThe version I created applies the Dracula color scheme a bit differently, with a focus on accessibility guidelines, and submitting a PR would effectively mean replacing the existing theme, which I don’t think makes sense since the current one is perfectly valid. I just had a slightly difference stylistic take.\n\nI’m happy for this request to be closed or ignored. Thanks for taking the time to review it!",
