You did a great job for a new GitHub user ;)\r\n\r\nI just cloned your repo and pushed all the commits to a [new one over here](https://github.com/dracula/jgrasp). I also sent you an invite to join the Dracula org. You'll continue maintaining this project, the only difference is that we can make it more visible and include it on the [site](https://draculatheme.com).\r\n\r\nWe have the screenshot already, that's great! The next steps would be adding instructions on how to install it. You can leave them here and I can put them on the site.\r\n\r\nYou can also update some of the information on the README like the [team section](https://github.com/dracula/jgrasp#team).\r\n\r\nAnyways, thanks for the contribution!",
