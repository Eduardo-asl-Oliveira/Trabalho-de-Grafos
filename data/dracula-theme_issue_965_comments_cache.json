Therefore, we have decided to launch the package, in its version 2.0, with JetBrains Fleet & Legacy (for those we previously had with some critical fixes).\r\n\r\nAs with everything we do, this iteration is produced with the utmost care, and we want to continue adding value and growing our community.",
